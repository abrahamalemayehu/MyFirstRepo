 What I have learned from this course

During my learning journey with ALX, I gained a deeper understanding of what 
entrepreneurship truly means beyond simply starting a business. I learned that entrepreneurship is a mindset—one that embraces 
creativity, resilience, and problem-solving. ALX emphasized that successful entrepreneurs don’t just chase ideas; they identify real
 problems in society and use innovation to create impactful solutions. This shift in perspective helped me see opportunities in everyday challenges 
 and think more critically about how value is created.
